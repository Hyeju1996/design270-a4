# design270-q4

## Cocept

- website is about coffee, and if I work at the coffee shop for webdeveloper I want a try with this.

- Wehn I made websites I made logos my self and suddenly idea is poped out from logo would be nice. Its just frame design work but I put this design slice the soul.

- When I making website I asked who really good at design stuff and they gave me effort on it.

- I focused more about navaigation bar how ldesign looks better and logos too.
